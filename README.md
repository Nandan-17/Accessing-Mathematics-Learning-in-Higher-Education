An analytical study of student responses to mathematics questions in higher education. The project uses a dataset of nearly ten thousand responses across multiple countries, topics, and difficulty levels. The analysis provides insights into student performance, challenging concepts, and potential improvements in mathematics education.

# üåü Overview
This project explores how students in different countries perform in higher education mathematics.  
The dataset includes student demographics, question attributes (level, topic, subtopic), and answer correctness.  

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of trends and performance patterns  
- Insights into learning difficulties and strengths  

The goal is to understand learning accessibility in mathematics and provide a foundation for future predictive models in education research.

# ‚ú® Key Features
- Comprehensive dataset of 9546 student responses across 8 countries  
- Analysis of student performance based on:  
  - Country of origin  
  - Question difficulty (Basic vs Advanced)  
  - Mathematics topics and subtopics  
- Visualizations showing performance trends and patterns  
- Identification of the most challenging mathematical concepts  
- Research-oriented structure that can be extended to machine learning tasks
