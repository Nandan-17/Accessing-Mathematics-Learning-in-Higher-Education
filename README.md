# 🎓 Accessing Mathematics Learning in Higher Education
Status: Active Jupyter Notebook
Visit the project notebook for full analysis: [Notebook Link]
An analytical study of student responses to mathematics questions in higher education. The project uses a dataset of nearly ten thousand responses across multiple countries, topics, and difficulty levels. The analysis provides insights into student performance, challenging concepts, and potential improvements in mathematics education.

# 🌟 Overview
This project explores how students in different countries perform in higher education mathematics. The dataset includes student demographics, question attributes (level, topic, subtopic), and answer correctness.
The notebook walks through the process of:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization of trends and performance patterns
Insights into learning difficulties and strengths
The goal is to understand learning accessibility in mathematics and provide a foundation for future predictive models in education research.

# ✨ Key Features
Comprehensive dataset of 9546 student responses across 8 countries
Analysis of student performance based on:
Country of origin
Question difficulty (Basic vs Advanced)
Mathematics topics and subtopics
Visualizations showing performance trends and patterns
Identification of the most challenging mathematical concepts
Research-oriented structure that can be extended to machine learning tasks

# 💻 Technology Stack
Technology	Description
Python	Core programming language for analysis
Pandas	Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn	Data visualization
Scikit-learn	Optional machine learning tasks
